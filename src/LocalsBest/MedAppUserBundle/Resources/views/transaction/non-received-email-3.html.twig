Despite our previous request, you have failed to upload your new listing, {% if data is defined %}{{ data.mlsNumber }}{% else %}*transaction_mls_number*{% endif %} located at {% if data is defined %}{{ data.address }}{% else %}*transaction_address*{% endif %} to our Agent Power Platform.<br>
<br>
State law requires you to report any new contracts to your brokerage within 24 hours.  You have failed to do so.  You now have 24 hours to go to the agentpowerplatform.com, enter your new listing and upload your paperwork to avoid a $25 fine.<br>
<br>
Not providing your listing paperwork to your brokerage is a serious matter and although we hate to issue fines, failure to upload your listing will result in a $25 fine.<br>
<br>
If you have already uploaded your listing and you are receiving this email in error, please contact Janis Kucsak by emailing her at jakucsak@crrli.net and she will be happy to help.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.<br>
