Hello {% if user is defined %}{{ user.fullName }}{% else %}*agent_full_name*{% endif %}! Seems like one of the transactions you created - {% if transaction is defined %}{{ transaction.fullAddress }}{% else %}*transaction_address*{% endif %} - has
{% if docs is defined %}{{ docs }}{% else %}*documents_count*{% endif %} document(s) that are still not uploaded. Please provide them to the EasyCloses system in order
to check and close the transaction.<br>
<br>
If you experience any difficulties in uploading documents to the transaction, please call 1 (888) 740-0550 and
LocalsBest will assist you.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your care and have a good day!<br>
